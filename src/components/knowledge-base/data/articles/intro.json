    "content": "<h2>What is Intent Protocol?</h2><p>Intent Protocol is a revolutionary DeFi platform built on the Movement blockchain. Unlike traditional DEXs where you execute specific transactions against a smart contract, Intent Protocol allows you to sign an <strong>Intent</strong>—a declaration of your desired outcome.</p><h3>Why Intents?</h3><p>Intents offer several major advantages over traditional transactions:</p><ul><li><strong>Gasless Experience:</strong> Makers (users) only sign messages. Solvers (relayers) pay the gas fees to execute the swap.</li><li><strong>MEV Protection:</strong> By defining your output, you protect yourself from front-running and slippage beyond your limit.</li><li><strong>Best Execution:</strong> Relayers compete to fill your order, ensuring you get the best market price available.</li></ul><h3>How to Use</h3><p>Simply connect your wallet, select the 'Market' or 'Limit' tab, choose your tokens, and sign the intent. Ideally, your order will be filled instantly!</p>",
