# One Unified Liquidity Layer

The vision of Intent Protocol extends beyond a single chain. We are actively developing strict **Atomic Cross-Chain Swaps**.

## The Vision

Imagine having USDC on Ethereum, but wanting to buy a strictly Move-native asset on Movement or Aptos.
Traditionally, this requires:
1.  Bridging USDC to the destination chain (waiting 10-30 mins).
2.  Finding a DEX.
3.  Swapping.

With **Intent Protocol Cross-Chain**, you simply express the intent:

> "I want to sell 1000 USDC (on Ethereum) and receive APT (on Aptos)."

## How it Will Work

1.  **Market Makers**: Specialized Solvers maintain inventory on both chains.
2.  **Atomic Verification**: We are building a sophisticated verification layer that proves a transaction occurred on the source chain before releasing funds on the destination chain.
3.  **One Click**: To you, it's a single signature. The complex bridging happens under the hood.

## Roadmap

*   **Phase 1**: Intra-chain Swaps (Live Now)
*   **Phase 2**: Limit Orders (Live Now)
*   **Phase 3**: Cross-Chain Intents (In Development)

Stay tuned for our upcoming announcements!
